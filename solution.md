### Approach & Analysis

When I first analyzed the graph, I quickly saw that the structure wasn’t optimized for how queries were actually being made. The graph had 500 nodes and 1022 edges, averaging about two edges per node. Digging into the query data, I found that only 37 nodes were ever queried, and one node alone was hit 21 times. This was a clear sign that the graph didn’t reflect actual query behavior—most of the nodes were irrelevant, while the high-traffic nodes weren’t connected in a way that made them easy to reach. Instead of a structured, efficient graph, the layout was essentially random, leading to long, inefficient search paths. My goal became clear: restructure the graph so that the most frequently queried nodes had more direct and reliable paths while staying within the edge constraints.

### Optimization Strategy

Instead of creating an evenly connected graph, I focused on restructuring it around the actual query patterns. My approach revolved around identifying the most frequently queried nodes and ensuring they had stronger connections. First, I analyzed query results to count how often each target node was hit, sorting them by frequency. Then, I defined a threshold of 50, selecting the most commonly queried nodes below this index as my primary candidates for optimization. I prioritized connecting these nodes into a structured cycle to ensure that high-frequency targets could be reached efficiently. Additionally, I identified secondary nodes (those that were less frequently queried but still below the threshold) and linked them in a secondary cycle to improve connectivity further. Finally, I ensured that every other node outside this high-traffic region had at least one direct link to the primary candidates, reinforcing global connectivity without adding unnecessary edges. This structured approach allowed me to create an efficient graph that naturally funneled random walks toward frequently queried areas while keeping the total number of edges constrained.

### Implementation Details

The implementation came down to three key steps: analyzing query distribution, restructuring connections based on frequency, and verifying constraints. First, I parsed the query results and ranked nodes by how often they were queried, using this ranking to determine which nodes were most critical. I then built the new graph by systematically adding edges—first connecting the primary candidates, then the secondary nodes, and finally ensuring that all remaining nodes had a path to the primary group. The biggest challenge was balancing connectivity with the strict edge limits. I had to ensure that the graph remained well-connected without exceeding the maximum edges per node or total edges allowed. To manage this, I built in checks to prevent nodes from exceeding their connection limits and adjusted the graph iteratively until it met all constraints.

### Results

The final optimization led to a dramatic improvement. The query success rate increased from 79.5% to 100%, meaning every query successfully reached its target. More importantly, the median path length dropped from 569 steps to just 7, making queries nearly instantaneous compared to the original graph. This was a direct result of the more structured connectivity which in turn boosted my challenge score, which rewards both success rate and path efficiency. While in my first iterations the challenge score was in the 200 range, my final iteration produced a score of 541.02. The optimized graph also remained fully compliant with the given constraints.

### Trade-offs & Limitations

The main limitation of this approach is that it’s optimized for the current query patterns. If those patterns shift significantly, if different nodes start getting queried more frequently, the structure may no longer be ideal, and a different optimization might be necessary. Additionally, because I focused heavily on improving access to the most frequently queried nodes, less commonly queried nodes didn’t receive as much optimization. While they remained accessible through the broader connectivity structure, their paths weren’t as short as those of the high-traffic nodes. However, this approach still struck a strong balance between efficiency and scalability.

### Iteration Journey

My optimization approach evolved significantly through multiple iterations. Initially, I tried a hierarchical structure connecting all nodes in sequential global rings and adding layers of rings among the top queried nodes. While it improved path efficiency slightly, this structure proved too restrictive and didn’t fully leverage query data. Once I realized this, I shifted to a more adaptive method that prioritized connections based on actual query importance rather than enforcing strict cycles. By selectively enhancing connectivity around high-frequency nodes and allowing secondary nodes to naturally integrate into this structure, I was able to achieve greater efficiency. This flexible, data-driven approach inevitably led to the substantial performance gains in my final implementation.
