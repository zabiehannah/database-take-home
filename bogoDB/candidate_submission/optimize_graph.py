    # Your goal is to optimize the graph structure to:
    # 1. Increase the success rate of queries
    # 2. Minimize the path length for successful queries
    #
    # You have access to:
    # - initial_graph: The current graph structure
    # - results: The results of running queries on the initial graph
    #
    # Query results contain:
    # - Each query's target node
    # - Whether the query was successful
    # - The path taken during the random walk
    #
    # Remember the constraints:
    # - max_total_edges: Maximum number of edges in the graph
    # - max_edges_per_node: Maximum edges per node
    # - All nodes must remain in the graph
    # - Edge weights must be positive and â‰¤ 10

    # This is just a basic example - you should implement a more
    # sophisticated strategy based on query analysis!
